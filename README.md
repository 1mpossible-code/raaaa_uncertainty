# Team Uncertainty
## Created by Irene Yang, Ä°layda Dilek, Michelle Li, Maksym Yemelianenko, and Mattias Larsson.

### We are a group of NYU Tandon students with majors ranging from Applied Physics to Computer Engineering. We chose the SandboxAQ challenge for the NYC Quantum Computing Haqathon.

The goal of our project is to calculate the ground and excited states of LiH using quantum computing algorithms.
